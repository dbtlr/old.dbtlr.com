# Personal Domain Card

A small React application that hosts my domain card for http://dbtlr.com.

Why React? Not for any real technical reason, mostly just playing around with having a simple React application that is compiled by Webpack. Honestly, this could have been a static HTML page, but this was more fun to put together.

## Main technologies used

- React
- Webpack
- Babel (for ES6 and JSX compilation)
- Sass

## Future Potential Upgrades

- React driven contact page
- Activity feed read off of APIs from other sites (blogs, twitter, etc)
- Auto-generated /now page
- Realtime resume / profile / timeline
